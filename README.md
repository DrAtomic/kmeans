# kmeans
This is my implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm used to cluster and classify the OptDigits data originally from the [UCI ML repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits).

##**Usage:**
To run the project, use `python k_means.py` with the optdigits folder in the same path.

The cluster images generated by the script are only 8x8 pixels, so I included a resizing script. After running `python resize.py`, it will prompt you for an integer to scale the images.

##**Dependencies:**
- [*NumPy*] (http://www.numpy.org) for calculations, and 
- [*Pillow*] (https://python-pillow.org) for visualizing the clusters.
