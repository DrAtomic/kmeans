# kmeans
This is my implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm used to cluster and classify the OptDigits data originally from the [UCI ML repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits).


##**Dependencies:**
I used:
- *NumPy* for calculations, and 
- *Pillow* for visualizing the clusters.
